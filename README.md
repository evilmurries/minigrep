# Minigrep

## What is it?

An implementation of grep written in Rust.

## Why??

Mostly so I can learn / practice Rust. This project is from chapter
12 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

If you have any suggestions or comments that might help me to learn, or
as best practices for a new college grad, please feel free to create an issue
with your advice! I would greatly appreciate it.
